# RBAC Backend for StackStorm
[![RBAC Unit Tests Status](https://circleci.com/gh/StackStorm/st2-rbac-backend/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/StackStorm/st2-rbac-backend) 

The RBAC backend started as part of StackStorm core repo and then moved out into a separate
repo for enterprise purposes. Some enterprise features such as RBAC has been made open
sourced as part of the donation to Linux Foundation in 2019.

NOTE: Due to the original code structure and the code originally living as part of the
open source StackStorm/st2 repo, some of the utility RBAC code is still part of the open
source repo (that code is of little use without the permission resolving classes which
contain majority of the business logic though).

## Installation

NOTE: This happens automatically when using bwc installer script.

1. Make sure the backend Python package is installed inside StackStorm virtualenv
   (``/opt/stackstorm/st2/``)
2: Edit StackStorm config (``/etc/st2/st2.conf``):

```ini
...
[rbac]
enable = True
backend = default
...
3. Restart all the services - ``sudo st2ctl restart``

## Running Lint Checks and Tests

To run lint checks and unit tests you can use ``lint`` and  ``unit-tests`` make targets.
This will clone ``StackStorm/st2`` repo into ``/tmp/st2``, install StackStorm dependencies in
a purpose built virtual environment and add all StackStorm Python packages from
``/tmp/st2``  into ``PYTHONPATH`` for those make targets.

```bash
make lint
make unit-tests
```

If virtual environment is already created and all the dependencies installed, you can skip
dependency steps by simply running lint and tests:

```bash
make .lint
make .unit-tests
```

If you want to test those changes against a specific version of StackStorm/st2 repo, you can set
``ST2_REPO_BRANCH`` environment variable. For example:

```bash
ST2_REPO_BRANCH=my-super-feature make unit-tests
```

Keep in mind that you can also simply symlink your working copy of ``StackStorm/st2`` repo to
``/tmp/st2``. This way you can test changes with your work which hasn't been committed / pushed
upstream yet.
